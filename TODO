Global:
    * UI love
        * volumes - sliders!  live volume check.
        * Menu items - check box next to when enabled.
	* use a glade UI config, rather than all this tweaking code in C#

Sleep Timer:
    * Evaluate sleep timer fade out - is this what we want?  It fades out till the end of track, and then pauses.

Alarm:
    * Have different alarm times for each day of the week. Who wants to wake up early on Sunday mornings ?
