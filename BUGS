Known bugs:
	* UI niceness.  We know.
	* --enable-user-plugin does not work right since we're installing a gconf schema for alarm keys.  anyone know a workaround?
    * Sleep dialog:
		* when opening after it was set before, does not read values from old variable properly.
			* Should read the difference between set time and dialog open time, and subtract that from the old sleep timer value.
