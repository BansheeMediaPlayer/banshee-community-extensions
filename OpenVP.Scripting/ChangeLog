	* AssemblyInfo.cs, ScriptCompileException.cs, UserScript.cs,
	  AffeScript.cs, ScriptingEnvironment.cs: Change license from GPLv2
	  to LGPLv3.

2007-12-30  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* UserScript.cs: The Call getter will now catch any compilation exception to
	  provide consistent behaivor; it should return null whenever the script
	  didn't properly compile.  Run() now does nothing if the compiled call is
	  null instead of throwing an exception.  Added Run overload matching the
	  System.EventHandler signature for simpler tying to events (e.g.
	  keybindings).  Added protected virtual implementation of
	  OnDeserialization so that subclasses can override it.
	* AffeScript.cs: Create an AffeCompiler using the type of the serialized
	  target object by default during deserialization.

	* AffeScript.cs: Removed NonSerializedAttribute from mTargetObject.

2007-12-23  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* UserScript.cs: Added NonSerializedAttribute to UserScript.mCallWrapper.

2007-12-18  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* UserScript.cs: Renamed PerformCall to Run and made public since delegates
	  targetting private methods cannot be deserialized.

2007-12-18  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* ScriptCompileException.cs, OpenVP.Scripting.mdp: Added
	  ScriptCompileException.
	* UserScript.cs: Marked ScriptCall serializable.  Added CallWrapper property
	  that returns a delegate that calls the same delegate returned by Call. 
	  (CallWrapper would be used to serialize a delegate with its
	  corresponding UserScript instance so that it can be properly
	  deserialized.)
	* AffeScript.cs: Catch AffeExceptions and turn them into instances of the
	  new ScriptCompileException.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs, OpenVP.Scripting.mdp, UserScript.cs, ChangeLog,
	  AffeScript.cs, ScriptingEnvironment.cs: Added OpenVP.Scripting project.
