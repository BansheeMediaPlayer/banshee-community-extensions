	* UserScript.cs: Renamed PerformCall to Run and made public since delegates
	  targetting private methods cannot be deserialized.

2007-12-18  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* ScriptCompileException.cs, OpenVP.Scripting.mdp: Added
	  ScriptCompileException.
	* UserScript.cs: Marked ScriptCall serializable.  Added CallWrapper property
	  that returns a delegate that calls the same delegate returned by Call. 
	  (CallWrapper would be used to serialize a delegate with its
	  corresponding UserScript instance so that it can be properly
	  deserialized.)
	* AffeScript.cs: Catch AffeExceptions and turn them into instances of the
	  new ScriptCompileException.
