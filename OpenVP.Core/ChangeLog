	* BurstScope.cs: Allow random ray speed between a minimum and maximum,
	  to avoid the appearance of circles.

2008-04-11  Chris Howie <me@chrishowie.com> 

	* DynamicMovement.cs, ClearScreen.cs, SuperScope.cs, Scope.cs,
	  Buffer.cs: Add AuthorAttribute.
	* MovementBase.cs: Add missing SerializableAttribute.  Remove metadata
	  from properties and make them protected, since subclasses may not
	  want these exposed in the designer (e.g. the new Mirror effect). 
	  Add protected MakeStaticDirty method to allow subclasses to notify
	  MovementBase that the static movement data needs to be recomputed.
	* Laser.cs: Add AuthorAttribute.  Change default end color.
	* OpenVP.Core.mdp, Mirror.cs: Add Mirror effect.
	* BurstScope.cs: Add AuthorAttribute.  Multiply final ray alpha by the
	  alpha of the selected color.

	* Laser.cs, OpenVP.Core.mdp: Finish Laser port and add some new
	  properties.
	* BurstScope.cs: Remove some unused code.

	* DynamicMovement.cs, MovementBase.cs, ClearScreen.cs, SuperScope.cs,
	  Scope.cs, Buffer.cs: Track move from System.ComponentModel to
	  OpenVP.Metadata.
	* Laser.cs: Copy Kaffeeklatsch's Laser effect, which is not yet ported
	  (build disabled).

	* TextureHandle.cs: Prevent deletion of the texture when requested on a
	  thread other than the one the texture was allocated on.  Add
	  destructor.
	* DynamicMovement.cs: Use SharedTextureHandle for the movement texture.
	* SharedTextureHandle.cs: Add class encapsulating a texture that will
	  be used by multiple consumers.
