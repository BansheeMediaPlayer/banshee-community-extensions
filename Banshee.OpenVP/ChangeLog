	* VisualizationDisplayWidget.cs: Switch to a single-threaded GL model. 
	  Rendering now happens on the GTK mainloop thread.  Added
	  NullPlayerData as a beat detector.
	* Gtk/GLWidget.cs: Re-enable built-in expose event handler contents and
	  fix OnRender to store the handler instead of catching NRE (aside
	  from being inefficient, this could discard NREs thrown by the event
	  handler).
	* ChangeLog: Add change logs.
	* Banshee.OpenVP.Visualizations/SimpleScope.cs: Enable mirror.
