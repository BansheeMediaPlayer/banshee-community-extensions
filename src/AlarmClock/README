Alarm & Sleep Timer extension
-----------------------------

ABOUT:
=================
This is a relatively simple extension to the Banshee media player, which allows the user to set an alarm time, and a sleep time.

FEATURES:
=================
Alarm:
* Set wake up time
* Start and End volumes, with a variable duration.
	* Example:  Set start to 10, and end to 85.  Duration to 600 seconds
	  Will increase the volume by one unit every 8 seconds (600/(85-10)) until it reaches 85.
* Can execute an arbitrary command on alarm trigger (eg. to set system volume)

Sleep Timer:
* Set Sleep Time (hours, minutes):
  After the number of hours/minutes specified, will trigger the sleep timer
  Sleep Timer finishes playing the current song, and fades it out from the current volume to zero.


HOW TO USE:
=================
It's almost too easy!
Go to the "Tools/Alarm Clock" menu, and select "Alarm" or "Sleep Timer", depending on which one you want to configure.
Edit the settings and click OK.
Easy as that!

To configure volume changing settings for alarm timer, go to "Tools/Alarm Clock", click on "Configure" tab, and change settings as desired.
