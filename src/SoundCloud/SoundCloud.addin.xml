  <!--  Extensions are loaded by Banshee via Mono.Addins by extending a
        particular ExtensionPoint. 

        There is a very general ExtensionPoint called
        /Banshee/ServiceManager/Service, and there are several much more
        specific ones.  A Service extension will be instantiated when Banshee
        starts, and can do whatever it wants with the Banshee API.  Where an
        ImportSource extension will be loaded when the user opens the Import
        Dialog.

        Here is an example of how to define an extension point:

        <Extension path="ExtensionPointPath">
            <ExtensionPointType class="Banshee.SoundCloud.SoundCloudExtensionPointType"/>
        </Extension>

        An extension must have one or more such definitions.

        Here are the ExtensionPoints in Banshee:
        
            Path: /Banshee/ServiceManager/Service
            Type: Service
            Desc: General purpose, run any code, instantiated at startup

            Path: /Banshee/SourceManager/Source
            Type: Source
            Desc: Create a Source in the source list

            Path: /Banshee/Library/ImportSource
            Type: ImportSource
            Desc: Add an entry to the Import Dialog dropdown.

            Path: /Banshee/Gui/TrackEditor/NotebookPage
            Type: TrackEditorPage
            Desc: Add a tab("page") to the Edit Track Information or Properties
                  dialogs.

            Path: /Banshee/Gui/TrackEditor/Modifier
            Type: Modifier
            Desc: Defines an extension for the track editor that can modify it in
                  some way.

            Path: /Banshee/ThickClient/ContextPane
            Type: ContextPage
            Desc: Defines a new GTK+ context page, for showing contextual
                  information beneath the main track source view.

        There are quite a few other ExtensionPoints, but they are mostly related to
        providing platform-specific backends for hardware integration and the like.

  <!-- Define a Source extension.  This will instantiate a new Source object,
       listed in the left-most Source TreeView. -->
  <Extension path="/Banshee/SourceManager/Source">
    <Source class="Banshee.SoundCloud.SoundCloudSource"/>
  </Extension>
