Version 1.5.4 - Feb 24, 2010
============================

Banshee Community Extensions is a sub-project of Banshee, where the
community can work on upcoming extensions with fewer barriers to entry.

Learn more: http://banshee-project.org/download/extensions/

In this first release, we have migrated nine community extensions that were
previously hosted all over (Google Code, Gitorious, self-hosted), including
their full commit history.  These are:

  AlarmClock, Awn, ClutterFlow, LCD, Lirc, Lyrics, Mirage,
  RadioStationFetcher, StreamRecorder

Since migrating them, some changes have been made:

  * Mirage now adds shuffle-by-similar and fill-by-similar modes instead
    of adding its own automatic-playlist source.

  * All extensions can be found in Preferences under the 'Community
    Extensions' category

  * All extensions are disabled by default; enable in Preferences
