Version 1.5.4 - Feb 24, 2010
============================

Banshee Community Extensions is a sub-project of Banshee, where the
community can work on upcoming extensions with fewer barriers to entry.

In this first release, we have migrated nine community extensions that were
previously hosted all over (Google Code, Gitorious, self-hosted), including
their full commit history.  These are:

  AlarmClock, Awn, ClutterFlow, LCD, Lirc, Lyrics, Mirage,
  RadioStationFetcher, StreamRecorder

Since migrating them, some changes have been made:

  * Mirage now adds shuffle-by-similar and fill-by-similar modes instead
    of adding its own automatic-playlist source.

  * All extensions can be found in Preferences under the 'Community
    Extensions' category

  * All extensions are disabled by default
