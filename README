Alarm & Sleep Timer plugin
--------------------------

ABOUT:
=================
This is a relatively simple plugin, which allows the user to set an alarm time, and a sleep time.

FEATURES:
=================
Alarm:
* Set wake up time
* Start and End volumes, with a variable duration.
	* Example:  Set start to 10, and end to 85.  Duration to 600 seconds
	  Will increase the volume by one unit every 8 seconds (600/(85-10)) until it reaches 85.
* Can execute an arbitrary command on alarm trigger (eg. to set system volume)

Sleep Timer:
* Set Sleep Time (hours, minutes):
  After the number of hours/minutes specified, will trigger the sleep timer
  Sleep Timer finishes playing the current song, and fades it out from the current volume to zero.


HOW TO USE:
=================
It's almost too easy!
Go to the edit menu, and select alarm or sleep timer, depending on which one you want to configure.
Edit the settings and click OK.
Easy as that!

To configure volume changing settings for alarm timer, go to Edit/Plugins..., click on Alarm & Sleep Timer, click on the Configure tab, and change settings as desired.
