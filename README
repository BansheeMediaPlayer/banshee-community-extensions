Banshee Community Extensions is a repository and project for extensions to the
Banshee media player that are community contributed and maintained.

By bringing various third-party extensions into this one project, we can help
each other maintain them and keep them up to date with the latest Banshee API.

This is meant to be a low-barrier-to-entry way to start, develop, and publish
a Banshee extension.
